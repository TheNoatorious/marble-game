# Marble Race Game

This project is a physics-based game built using ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, with physics powered by Rapier and UI/UX helpers from @react-three/drei.

The game is a hands-on way to apply web development and 3D graphics concepts.

## Gameplay Overview

You control a marble that must navigate through a series of obstacles to reach the finish line.
The level is constantly changing, ensuring that each run is unique!

### Key Mechanics:

-   Marble Movement: Use the keyboard to move the marble and make it jump over obstacles.
-   Timer: As soon as the marble starts moving, a timer kicks in, tracking how long it takes you to complete the course.
-   Dynamic Levels: After finishing the course, a "Restart" button will appear. Clicking it resets the marble, the timer, and - generates a new set of obstaclesâ€”no two levels are the same!

## Learning Objectives

-   Physics-based interactions
-   User interface & components
-   Keyboard controls
-   Global state management
